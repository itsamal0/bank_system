A **console-based Bank Management System** written in C++.

This project is part of my **Learning Path**, done during **Course 7 (Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 3)**  
from the **Programming Advices roadmap**.  
You can explore my full Learning Path repository here: [Learning Path Repository](https://github.com/itsamal0/learning-path)

This project helps me practice problem-solving, clean modular C++ coding, and applying concepts in a real project.
